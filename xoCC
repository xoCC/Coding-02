#Asking user to provide amount of initial deposit (principal amount)
principal_amount = float(input('Enter your principal deposit: $  '))
#Asking user to provide interest rate as a percentage
rate = int(input('Enter annual interest rate:   '))
#converting user input percentage rate to decimal for calculating
rate = rate/100
#Asking user to input interest compounding frequency
times_per_year = int(input('Enter the number of times per year interested will be compounded:  '))
#Asking user how long (time expressed in years) account will be compounding interest
years = int(input('Enter the number of years the account will be left to earn interest:  '))
nt = years * times_per_year
#A= account balance after user specified number of years
A = float(principal_amount * (1 + (rate/years))**(nt))
print('Your account balance will be $' +
      format(A, '.2f') + ' in ' + str(years) + ' years. ')
